## Edge Config Structure
```json
{
  "greeting": "hello world",
  "contactSubmissions": [
    // Array of form submissions
    {
      "id": "submission_timestamp",
      "name": "User Name",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "phone": "Optional phone number",
      "company": "Optional company name",
      "service": "Selected service",
      "message": "User message",
      "createdAt": "ISO timestamp"
    }
  ]
}
```
